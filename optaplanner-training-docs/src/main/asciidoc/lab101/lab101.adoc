=== Lab 101: No more than 4 processes per computer

The customer's use case is closely resembles the OptaPlanner example CloudBalancing.
But there's 1 big difference: No computer can have more than 4 processes assigned.

==== Preparation

. Import as a new project in your favorite IDE: +optaplanner-training-lab101/pom.xml+
. Create a new run configuration:
.. Main class: +org.optaplanner.examples.cloudbalancing.app.CloudBalancingApp+
.. VM parameters (optional): +-Xmx512M -server+
.. Working directory: +optaplanner-training-lab101+ (this is the directory that contains the directory +data+)
. Run the run configuration.
.. _Quick open_ +4computer-12processes.xml+.
.. _Solve_ it.
.. _Terminate solving early_ after about 20 seconds.
.. Notice how the solution assigns 6 processes to computer 0:

.. Leave this window open to compare it later with your modified version.

==== Assignment

. Add a new hard constraint that no computer should have more than 4 processes assigned to it.

==== Success criteria

. _Open_ and _solve_ +4computer-12processes.xml+. It should no longer have a computer with more than 4 processes:
+

. _Open_ and _solve_ +100computer-300processes.xml+, in both the old and the new window. Compare the results.
.. Both solutions should become feasible (+0hard+).
.. The old window's soft score is clearly better because it has more flexibility.

==== Tips

* Add a new score rule in the file +cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl+. No other files require changes.
* Read up about http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#scoreTrap[score traps],
especially if +100computer-300processes.xml+ does not become feasible.

==== Solution

Add this in the file +cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl+:

[source,drl]
----
rule "atMost4ProcessesPerComputer"
  when
    $computer : CloudComputer()
    $count : Number(intValue > 4) from accumulate(
    $c : CloudProcess(computer == $computer),
      count($c)
    )
  then
    scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, 4 - $count.intValue());
end
